.SH NAME
just, fill \- simple text formatting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B just
[
.I nnn
]
< file ...
.PP
.B fill
[
.I nnn
]
< file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I just
and
.I fill
are filters for filling and right justifying or simply filling
lines of text, respectively.  They are intended to be used to
filter text regions when called from an editor such as \fIvi\fP.
For example, in \fIvi\fP, to format the entire buffer the command
would be:
.sp
.B
:1,$!just
.PP
If no argument is given, the right margin defaults to column 65,
otherwise \fInnn\fP specifies a column number in the range 1 <= \fInnn\fP <= 510.
.PP
Each paragraph of text is indented based on how it was given in the
input: The first line will have the same indentation as in the input,
and the rest of the paragraph is indented the same as the second line
of the input (if any).
.PP
Tabs are converted to spaces on input.  An extra space at the end of
a sentence is preserved if present in the input.
.PP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
ex(1), scribe(1), troff(1)
.SH BUGS
Does not hyphenate words when filling lines.  Words which can not
fit alone on one line are truncated.
